# craigsfinder

While one is perusing the gigs section of craigslist, you might find that "moving" jobs are frequently gone rather quickly, about 30 min in my experience. 

The current craigslist app being lacking, i decided to take it upon myself to create this basic app, which in it's completion will periodically scrape the craigslist gigs section for every job titled "moving' or "move" or "helper" and send push notifications to your device, so you can relax and enjoy media/projects while you remain competitively aware of the gig economy. 

Furthermore as this is a relatively  trivial app, i decided to limit myself to only using Google Bard, their Chat GPT-killer, to create this code. I will be detailing this in a youtube video, but for now 
i'm making the code available to anyone. 

as of today (june 30), i think i've gone as far as auto generated will take me, given the complexity of errors resulting from the autogenerated code, so i'll begin manually bug fixing and branching the project accordingly. 

This is not meant for app stores, but instead as a demonstration of autogenerated code 

## Getting Started

When i am done i will do my best to make this project run on both desktop and mobile, but will probably not give it the polish it needs to run on apple devices, given their restrictive attitude to "side loaded" software. However, one alternative would be to run this as a local web server on a apple device, and i'll consider making a branch for ios devices if there is some request for it.
